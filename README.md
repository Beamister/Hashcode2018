# Hash Code 2018

## Description 

Code produced to solve the Google Hash Code 2018 challenge. Apologies for the mess. To summarise, it was about producing the most efficient way to deal with the most amount of rides, where a ride has a starting point and a destination.

## How to run

```bash
./simulation.py <INPUT FILE>
```

For example:

```bash
./simulation.py input/a_example.in
```
